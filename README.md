# Rockfax Digital package-issue-tracker

This is for the packages - the tracker for the apps is [here](https://github.com/UKClimbing/rockfax-digital-issues/issues).

# What is this?
It's a repository that we will be using for tracking issues in the data packages for rockfax digital. We're planning on building a dedicated site for all this stuff, but right now we're using this github repo. 

We don't expect our users to come here to report issues, but you're welcome to if you want!

# How do I that then?
First of all, you'll need to have a github account. Then you can go to the [issues page](https://github.com/UKClimbing/rockfax-digital-package-issues/issues). If you want to make a new errata report, please verify you're not duplicating an existing one.
